# File Organizer
Ever download a bunch of Humble Bundle books and not know what to do with them? This will help.

This project is meant to organize a folder full of files. 

If you have a folder that contains

    a.something 
    a.this 
    a.that 
    b.something 
    b.this 
    b.that 
    c.something 
    c.this 
    c.that

This will create three folders called a,b,c and put the files in them accordingly.

Requirements:
- Python 3
- Dependency: os
- Dependency: shutil

Usage: python3 FileOrganizer.py
